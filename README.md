## Data Visualization on Real-estate market in San Francisco for the Proptech Application
 Proptech, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. They wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.
 
 Here, I have used data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market   that are viable investment opportunities.
